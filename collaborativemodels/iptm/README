Z. PREREQUISITES

This software requires the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) to run.  We
have included gsl object files compiled on our machine (Red Hat 4.1.2-46,
Dual Core AMD Opteron P 275), but this is not universally portable.

If compiling as below does not work, you should make sure GSL is
installed for development in your environment and provide a pointer to it
in static_model/Makefile (the appropriate location is specified in the
Makefile comments).

GSL is used by much scientific software (such as R and Matlab), so
there's a good chance it's already installed on your
computer. Otherwise, you can obtain GSL here:

   http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/


A. COMPILING

Change to the directory "static_model" and type "make legis".  (As
noted above, you may need to edit the Makefile and change Makefile
constants to point to local copies of shared libraries (such as gsl
and gsl_cblas) if these libraries are not installed in a standard
directory.

B. RUNNING

  0. Examples.
   At a command prompt, type the command "legis <flags>", where flags is a
   list of command-line options.  Several example commands are given in
  
    test.sh.

  1. Input format.
   The IPTM expects three datafiles.

   See test/ for examples of these documents.

   a. A comma-separated user file, with two columns of the form
     UserIdString,user metadata
   b. A comma-separated vote file, with three columns of the form
     +,DocIdString,UserIdString
   c. A one-line-per-doc with lines of the form:
     DocIdString word_index1:count1 ... word_indexN:countN

  2. Output files.
   The IPTM creates a variety of datafiles.  These summarize a model fit.
   These files begin with the string --checkpoint_prefix (where this
is specified to legis in the command-line) and end with the descriptive suffixes:
   beta.dat
   doc_ips.csv (includes the 1st-Nth doc ideal points)
   user_ips.csv (includes the 2nd-Nth user ideal points.  The first defaults to 1).
   gam.dat     (includes gammas, or unnormalized topic proportions for each document.
   parameters.dat (includes several parameters, such as iteration count.
   etas.csv    (eta coefficients)
   predictions (in-sample predictions, useful on validation datasets)

  3. Command-line flags of interest.
   Run legis --help to see a list of command-line flags and their values.

  4. Checkpoints.
  legis runs until it is well-converged, but this will often take place whn 

C. NON-SUPPORT and QUESTIONS
